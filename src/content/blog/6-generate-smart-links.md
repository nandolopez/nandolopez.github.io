# Generate Smart links

Recently I updated the [Social Media](https://nandolopez.github.io/contact) with smart links. As everyone that have different social media and want improve the user experience and his ratings of analytics. But native navigation have a big issue in mobile browsing, I'll explain you with following example:

- Native behaviour: If you like go to my youtube channel by default the link will go to m.youtube.com in your browser.
- Excepted behaviour: When you press my Youtube channel link, open the native Youtube App in your device instead the browser giving to the user the full native experience.

The solution are smart links but the usage requires Javascript. As you can see in my github, I combined React with Astro, anyway I'll give you a JavaScript vanilla solution.

## What is a smart link

It's a intelligent link that detect if you are browsing in a mobile or desktop device, and if you have a mobile device, redirect the link to native app if is installed. If is not installed will redirect to web browsing version.

## The problems that I found.

Depends of the web browsing I found the following issues:

- What happens? if user has a mobile without youtube native App, we have interest that redirect to m.youtube.com (Youtube's mobile dedicated domain).
- Exists services like Instagram that don't have a dedicated domain like "m.instagram.com". Directly Instagram.com is natively responsive and accommodate his UI to the device

## The code solution

Here we can do with different ways, and we are going to need 3 links (one 3rd optional depending of the website):

1. Normal desktop link (Example: youtube.com)
2. Smart link, this should start with the webpage name followed of :// and continue with a couple of commands that depends of the website that we want to redirect. The easyest way is request them to ChatGPT with bellow prompt. (Example: instagram://user?username=nandolopez_tech)
3. Mobile link, this is optional but few services as youtube have a dedicated domain for his web version (example: m.youtube.com)

### How to get Smart link with ChatGPT

Here you can use Google Gemini, Llama, or other IA. But please test in your phone that link works. The prompt is:

```
I want that convert the following links to a version that clicking, open the default application associated to this webpage instead web browsing: https://link.to/socialMedia
```

Example of prompt

```
I want that convert the following links to a version that clicking, open the default application associated to this webpage instead web browsing: https://x.com/NandoLopez_Tech
```

The IA's reply:
Here is an example of how you might format a link for Twitter:

```html
<a href="twitter://user?screen_name=NandoLopez_Tech">Open in Twitter App</a>
```

## Adding the Javascript logic to your code

The strategic will be that:

1. On click in the link don't do nothing (adding to href a #) and execute a Javascript function with parameters
   1. Desktop link
   2. Smart link (generated by ChatGPT)
   3. (Optional) mobile version link
2. Check if User's device is mobile
   1. If is mobile with a "try-catch" try to open in native app, if is not mobile go to desktop version.
   2. If fails, check if we received in the function the mobile version
      1. We recived: redirect to mobile version
   3. Previous steps fails, go directly to desktop version.

Here the Javscript code

```js
// Classic function declaration
function onClickLink(desktopLink, smartLink, mobileLink=undefined){
  // this regex detects if is a mobile device
  const regex = /Mobi|Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i;
  // is a mobile device = true / false
    const isMobile = navigator.userAgent.search(regex) >=0;

  // Checking if is mobile, if it's try to open in native app, if is desktop go to desktop version
    try {
        window.location.href = isMobile ? smartlink :desktopLink;
    } catch (error) {
    // If is a mobile and app is not installed go to mobile version
    // if mobile version is not defined go to desktop version
        window.location.href = mobilelink !== undefined ? mobilelink : desktopLink
    }finally{
    // If all previous code fails, go to desktop version
        window.location.href = desktopLink        
    }
}

```

Now only left add the Javascript to each link

```html
<a
  href="#"
  onClick="onClickLink('https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg4pdmmXX07n89Axjm41Gqw','vnd.youtube://channel/UCg4pdmmXX07n89Axjm41Gqw','https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCg4pdmmXX07n89Axjm41Gqw')"
>
  Got o my Youtube profile
</a>
<a
  href="#"
  onClick="onClickLink('https://www.instagram.com/nandolopez_tech','instagram://user?username=nandolopez_tech')"
>
  Visit my instagram
</a>
```

### Interest links

[React](https://github.com/nandolopez/nandolopez.github.io/blob/main/src/components/react/SmartLink.tsx) component that I've done for my Astro site.
Astro [page](https://github.com/nandolopez/nandolopez.github.io/blob/main/src/pages/contact.astro) where I combined with Astro.
